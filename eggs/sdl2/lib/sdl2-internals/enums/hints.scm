;;; Hints are defined differently than most other enums in this
;;; library. Instead of using the value from SDL's headers at compile
;;; time, the values are hardcoded into this library. The reasons for
;;; doing it this way are:
;;;
;;; - So that developers do not need to check the compiled version of
;;;   SDL before setting a hint. Developers can safely set any hint
;;;   with any version of SDL (unrecognized hints are ignored).
;;;
;;; - Because the constant values are explicitly defined strings, not
;;;   enums which have implicit values determined at compile time.
;;;
;;; - Because new hints are often added in new SDL versions, and the
;;;   implementation would be much more complex if we needed to check
;;;   the SDL version for every constant.
