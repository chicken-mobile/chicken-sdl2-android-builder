;;; Like foreign-value, except the body string is constructed
;;; dynamically (at macro expansion time) using sprintf.
;;;
;;; Usage:
;;;
;;;   (foreign-value-with-dynamic-body
;;;    (BODY-FORMATSTRING FORMAT-ARG ...)
;;;    FOREIGN-TYPE)
;;;
;;; This macro is used within other macros to generate foreign values
;;; based on a template. For example, a version number, type, or field
;;; name within the body can be filled in based on the arguments given
;;; to the high-level macro.
;;;
;;; Because the body string is constructed at macro expansion time,
;;; each FORMAT-ARG must be a literal value like a symbol, string, or
;;; number.
