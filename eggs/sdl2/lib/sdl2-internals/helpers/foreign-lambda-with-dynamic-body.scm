;;; Like foreign-lambda*, except the function body string is
;;; constructed dynamically (at macro expansion time) using sprintf.
;;;
;;; Usage:
;;;
;;;   (foreign-lambda*-with-dynamic-body
;;;    RETURN-TYPE
;;;    (ARG-TYPE ...)
;;;    (BODY-FORMATSTRING FORMAT-ARG ...))
;;;
;;; This macro is used within other macros to generate function bodies
;;; based on a template. For example, a type or field name within the
;;; function body can be filled in based on the arguments given to the
;;; high-level macro.
;;;
;;; Because the body string is constructed at macro expansion time,
;;; each FORMAT-ARG must be a literal value like a symbol, string, or
;;; number.
