(export sdl-failure)


;;; Returns an exception condition of kind (exn sdl2) indicating that
;;; an SDL function failed. Use abort to signal the exception.
;;;
;;; fn-name should be a string giving the name of the SDL function
;;; that failed. ret-code should be the integer error code that was
;;; returned by the failing function (usually -1), or #f if the
;;; function failed without an integer return code (e.g. it returned a
;;; NULL pointer instead).
;;;
;;; The error message is constructed automatically based on the
;;; function name, return code, and the error string from get-error.
;;;
;;; Examples:
;;;
;;;   ;; With return code
;;;   (let ((ret-code (SDL_Init ...)))
;;;     (unless (zero? ret-code)
;;;       (abort (sdl-failure "SDL_Init" ret-code))))
;;;
;;;   ;; Without return code
;;;   (let ((surface (SDL_CreateRGBSurface ...)))
;;;     (if (and (surface? surface) (not (struct-null? surface)))
;;;         surface
;;;         (abort (sdl-failure "SDL_CreateRGBSurface" #f))))
