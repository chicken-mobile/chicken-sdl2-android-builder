;;; Temporarily allocates some memory, executes the body, frees the
;;; memory that was allocated, then returns the value(s) of the final
;;; expression of the body. Supports multiple return values.
;;;
;;; IMPORTANT: For performance reasons, this macro is not designed to
;;; automatically free the memory if an exception is signalled from
;;; the body. If you intend to signal an exception from the body (e.g.
;;; because an SDL function failed), you should manually free the
;;; memory before signalling the exception.
;;;
;;; This is useful for wrapping C functions that use "output
;;; parameters", i.e. the function accepts some pointers, and modifies
;;; the values of the pointers as a way of returning multiple results.
;;;
;;; Example:
;;;
;;;   (with-temp-mem ((w-out (%allocate-Sint32))
;;;                   (h-out (%allocate-Sint32)))
;;;     (SDL_GetWindowSize window w-out h-out)
;;;     (values (pointer-s32-ref w-out)
;;;             (pointer-s32-ref h-out)))
;;;
