;;; Define a procedure that requires a minimum version of SDL. If
;;; chicken-sdl2 was COMPILED WITH a sufficient version of SDL, the
;;; function body will be executed. Otherwise, an error will be thrown
;;; to explain the version requirement.
;;;
;;; Usage:
;;;
;;;   (define-versioned (FN-NAME FN-ARG ...)
;;;       FEATURE
;;;     BODY ...)
;;;
;;; FN-NAME is the name of the procedure to define. It will be defined
;;; by this macro.
;;;
;;; FN-ARG ... are the procedure arguments, like you would specify
;;; with a normal procedure definition or lambda.
;;;
;;; FEATURE is a feature identifier indicating which version of SDL
;;; the procedure depends on. Usually of the form `libSDL-X.Y.Z+'.
;;;
;;; BODY ... are the procedure body expressions that will be executed
;;; if the version requirement is met. If the requirement is not met,
;;; the body is ignored and an error is signalled instead.
;;;
;;; Example:
;;;
;;;   ;; Requires SDL 2.0.4 or higher.
;;;   (define-versioned (point-in-rect? point rect)
;;;       libSDL-2.0.4+
;;;     (SDL_PointInRect point rect))
